\section{Requirements}
\subsection{Problem Statement}
\begin{center}
    \textbf{``To design a cloth cleaning machine to wash dry uncolored cotton cloth post-manufacturing''-This needs to be bulky}
\end{center}

\subsection{Input Requirements}
\subsubsection{Cloth Details}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\scriptstyle\circ$] The cloth being cleaned is just-manufactured, uncolored cotton cloth, for general usage. The thickness is 1-ply, with a thread count of 400, and of denier 60 opaqueness.
    \item[$\scriptstyle\circ$] The dimensions of the cloth to be cleaned is of maximum 10m length and 2m width.
    \item[$\scriptstyle\circ$] The cloth has mostly oil-based stains to begin with, naturally imbued during the manufacturing process.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Other inputs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\scriptstyle\circ$] The machine works with pressured water available at an ambient temperature from an overhead tank of capacity 50l on-site.
    \item[$\scriptstyle\circ$] The machine works with water of $80mg/l$ $CaCO_3$ equivalent hardness.
    \item[$\scriptstyle\circ$] Expendable materials like Detergents, soaps,etc are to be treated as a running cost, and paid for by the client after installation.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Mode of Input}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\scriptstyle\circ$] The machine cleans in batches of 11 Kg dry weight per batch
    \item[$\scriptstyle\circ$] Only a single program for general washing is required
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Output Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\scriptstyle\circ$] The machine is required to both wash and dry the cloth.
    \item[$\scriptstyle\circ$] The machine is required to have the capability to sequentially process multiple batches prepared beforehand by the client.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Power Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\scriptstyle\circ$] The machine must be compatible with 220V AC 1-$\Phi$ (desirable) and 44V AC 3-$\Phi$ Power drawing a maximum current of 15A.
    \item[$\scriptstyle\circ$] The machine must be able to be connected to plug points upto 20m away.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Logistical Requirements}
\subsection{Environmental Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\scriptstyle\circ$] The machine must use as low an amount of resources(water, electricity) as possible, and comply with CPCB Regulations.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Site-Demanded Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\scriptstyle\circ$] The machine is designed to be used at Semi-industrial sites.
    \item[$\scriptstyle\circ$] The machine must produce a maximum noise intensity of 70dB.
    \item[$\scriptstyle\circ$] It is desirable but not essential that The machine be dis-assembleable and re-installable on request.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Structural Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\scriptstyle\circ$] The machine must be of maximum dimensions 25mx40mx60m, designed to be installed in an industrial-size shed.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Time Requirements}
\subsubsection{Design Time Requirements}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\scriptstyle\circ$] The maximum time to wash a batch must be under 45 minutes.
    \end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Time to Market Requirements}
\subsubsection{Life Time Requirements}
\subsubsection{End of Life Requirements}
